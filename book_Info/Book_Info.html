        It’s been a minute since Jordan Vargas last saw his college friends and 28 years since their graduation from Berkeley 
        when their adult lives officially began. Now Jordan, Jordy, Naomi, Craig, and Marielle find themselves at the brink 
        of a new decade, with all the responsibilities of adulthood, yet no closer to having their lives figured out. 
        A deeply honest tribute to the growing pains of selfhood and the people who keep us going, coupled with Steven 
        Rowley’s signature humor and heart, The Celebrants is a moving tale about the false invincibility of youth and the 
        beautiful ways in which friendship helps us celebrate our lives, even amid the deepest challenges of living.
